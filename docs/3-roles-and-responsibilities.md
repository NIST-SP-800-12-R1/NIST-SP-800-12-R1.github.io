# 3 Roles and Responsibilities
{: .no_toc }

1. TOC
{:toc}

The following chapter outlines specific organizational roles and their respective responsibilities. Clearly defined roles and responsibilities help the organization and its employees work in a more efficient manner by designating who is responsible for performing certain tasks. In a large organization, this will help by ensuring that no task is overlooked. In a small, less structured organization, the workload can be more evenly distributed as an employee may be required to take on more than one task.

The list provided below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all the possible roles within an organization. Each organization may define their own specific roles or have a different naming convention based on their mission or organizational structure. However, the basic functions remain the same. For a more detailed description of the responsibilities assigned to each role, see Appendix D in NIST SP 800- 37.

* Physical Security Staff. The physical security office is responsible for developing and enforcing appropriate physical security controls, often in consultation with information security management, program and functional managers, and others. Physical security addresses central system installations, backup facilities, and office environments. In the government, this office is often responsible for processing personnel background checks and security clearances.

In such cases, the staff is typically responsible for contingency planning for the entire organization and works with program and functional managers/application owners, the information security staff, and others to obtain additional contingency planning support, as needed.
* Quality Assurance Staff. Many organizations have established a quality assurance program to improve the products and services they provide to their customers. The quality assurance staff should have a working knowledge of information security and how it can be used to enhance the quality of the program (e.g., ensuring the integrity of computer-based information, the availability of services, and the confidentiality of customer information).
* Procurement Office Staff. The procurement (or acquisitions) office is responsible for ensuring that organizational procurements have been reviewed by appropriate officials.

The human resources office may also be responsible for security-related exit procedures when employees leave an organization.
* Risk Management/Planning Staff. Some organizations employ a full-time staff devoted to analyzing all manner of risks to which the organization may be exposed. Although this office normally focuses on organizational risk issues, it should also consider information security-related risks. Risk analyses for specific systems are not typically performed by this office.
* Physical Plant Staff. This office is responsible for ensuring the provision of the services necessary for the safe and secure operation of an organization's systems (e.g., electrical power and environmental controls). The office is often augmented by separate medical, fire, hazardous waste, or life safety personnel.
